            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Vinindu Thamara and I'm interesting in travel and photography.
                I created this website to share my knowledge and experiences around traveling in Sri Lanka.<br>

                Traveling is one of the most enriching experiences that one can have in their lifetime. Since my
                childhood I had a
                passion for travel.It exposes us to new cultures, and helps us gain a better understanding of the world
                around us.
                You can visit big cities, see beautiful landscapes, or just chill out on the beach. It's good to try new
                things and have fun.
                Traveling can make you feel better in your head and your body too. It can help you feel less worried and
                more happy.
                So, traveling is great and everybody should do it sometimes.<br>
                But it's not just the travel that I love, also I always try to make those memories into my collections
                through photography.
                As a nature lover, I try to expose those moments and feelings by capturing photos. So, make time to
                travel, feel the moments, listen to nature's creations,
                It will make you feel comfortable and happy.<br>
                Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy by
                sharing them with you!
            </p>
